The clock is ticking, the bubbles are bouncing, and the points are up for grabs! 
Bubble Hit is my fast-paced JavaScript game where users test their speed and accuracy by clicking on randomly generated numbers within a 60-second timer. 
Each successful pop earns a sweet 10 points, but beware - missing those bubbles will leave you empty-handed.

Here's what makes Bubble Hit pop:
   1.  Simple yet addictive gameplay: The intuitive click-to-score mechanics are easy to grasp but tough to master, encouraging players to come back for more.
   2.  Dynamic number generation: The ever-changing pool of numbers keeps players on their toes, demanding quick thinking and sharp reflexes.
   3.  Thrilling time pressure: The 60-second countdown adds a layer of excitement, pushing players to maximize their score under the ticking clock.
   4.  Clean and efficient JavaScript code: Bubble Hit showcases my ability to write clear, well-structured code for a smooth and engaging gaming experience.


Bubble Hit was more than just a game; it was a learning playground. It allowed me to:
      1. Sharpen my JavaScript skills.
      2. Experiment with dynamic elements and user interactions.
      3. Understand the importance of player engagement and user experience.

So, ready to put your reflexes to the test? Check out Bubble Hit and see how many bubbles you can pop before the clock runs out!
